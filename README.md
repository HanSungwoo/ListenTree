We aim for the user to reveal their inner thoughts while talking to the tree. As the user uses this app and shares their innermost feelings, “fruits” appear based on those expressions. Each fruit displays a summary of the conversation so far. Once three fruits appear, if the summary is positive, they become fully ripe fruits, and if negative, they become under-ripe fruits. Users can choose to save these fruits to the storage if they wish.

Additionally, the image above was implemented using Figma, and the actual appearance of the app may differ.
